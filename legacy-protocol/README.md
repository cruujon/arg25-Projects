Welcome to Invisible Garden- ARG25.

Each participant or team will maintain this README throughout the program.  
You'll update your progress weekly **in the same PR**, so mentors and reviewers can track your journey end-to-end.

## Project Description

# Heirloom Inheritance Protocol: Product Document

## Concept

A tool that allows people who wish to preserve cultural assets or secret knowledge to securely and permanently pass them down to others across generations.

---

## Problems in the Field and Product Value

### Field Situation

Currently, those who want to pass down their knowledge or skills have no choice but to share secret information directly—either orally or on paper.

There is no verifiable way to record *who passed it to whom*, which makes the extinction of such knowledge a real risk.

### Therefore, We Propose

By recording *who (wallet)* has passed their knowledge to *whom (wallet)* on the blockchain, we can preserve the lineage and history of these successions permanently.

At the same time, by using **an encrypted P2P messaging protocol** such as XMTP and **distributed storage** such as IPFS, we enable private and secure inheritance of valuable information across generations.

- Secret information can be inherited securely from one wallet address to another.
- As a result, traditional cultural assets and valuable private knowledge can be preserved and carried forward through time.

---

## Product Purpose (Purpose)

To make the process of inheriting personal knowledge and skills permanently traceable as a trustworthy record.

---

## Scope

✔ Recording the history of inheritance on-chain

✔ Encrypted transfer of secret data via XMTP

---

## Target Users

Individuals who wish to pass down their valuable private knowledge to the next generation **without making it public**.

Examples:

- A restaurant owner who possesses a secret recipe (a trade secret) but has no successor.
- A craftsman who holds local traditional techniques or special know-how that cannot be publicly shared.

---

## Functional Requirements

### Essential Features

- **Encrypted P2P messaging** that grants a specific wallet address access to secret information and the right to inherit it to the next generation.
- **Distributed storage** (e.g., IPFS or Arweave) to securely hold secret information, with token-gated access control.
- **Blockchain-based record** that logs *who transferred access rights (NFTs)* for the stored secret information to whom, ensuring an immutable record of succession.

---

## MVP Success Criteria (Definition of Completion)

### Short-Term (Within the Hackathon) – Mandatory

- Able to record at least one **inheritance event** from one wallet address to another on-chain (and obtain a Tx hash).
- Successful **encrypted message exchange** between two wallets (at least one round trip).
- A user interface where the user can clearly see that the inheritance has been completed.

### If Possible (Optional)

- Ability to visually verify within the wallet that the user holds the inherited right or that inheritance has occurred, represented as an NFT
