# ARG25 Project Submission Template

Welcome to Invisible Garden- ARG25.

Each participant or team will maintain this README throughout the program.  
You'll update your progress weekly **in the same PR**, so mentors and reviewers can track your journey end-to-end.

## Project Description

![🔷](https://discord.com/assets/764d6cc18dee3e92.svg)The underlying mindset that shapes my product: Many praise Ethereum as a persistent, immutable database — a place where data can live forever. But if we ask what deserves to live forever, or what humanity should find centuries from now as proof we once lived, it isn't transactions or tokens — it's our thoughts and beliefs. Humans long to leave something behind, to be remembered as beings of intent and meaning. This protocol fulfills that: preserving not what we owned, but what we believed — the essence of who we are — and passing it on, verifiably, to future generations. There's no reliable way to prove a message truly came from its author. Videos and letters can be forged. But through a credible, neutral system like Ethereum, we can record messages immutably — letting anyone forever trust the words of those who came before. ![🔷](https://discord.com/assets/764d6cc18dee3e92.svg)The protocol has 3 main functions:(not finalized yet tho) 0 . A system that lets users attach belief-based labels to their wallets — visible signals of what they stand for. These tags allow both people and protocols to choose who they interact with and under what principles. DeFi apps or voting platforms could, for instance, favor wallets tagged "Ethereum decentralization maximalist" or "Solana efficiency-oriented pragmatist." Unlike the implicit filtering we see through NFT ownership or token-gating, this system makes alignment explicit, voluntary, and user-owned — enabling trust and coordination built on shared conviction.

1. Private Heirline (Encrypted Legacy Messages),

Users can securely store and send encrypted messages or data to specific trusted contacts using protocols like XMTP or Lit Protocol. The content remains hidden until certain conditions are met — for example, a preset time period, verified identity checks, or guardian confirmations. Only the designated recipients can decrypt and access the message, ensuring privacy-preserving inheritance without any centralized control.

_What are you building and why does it matter? Explain the core problem and your proposed solution._

2. Public Baton Line (Anonymous Ideological Relay),

Users can also leave anonymous, onchain "thought capsules" — short statements, ideas, or reflections meant to be discovered and carried forward by future generations. Each relay passes the "baton" of an idea to the next participant, forming a visible lineage of influence while the message content itself remains encrypted. Over time, this creates a semantic web of inheritance — a living archive of human thought that evolves across identities and epochs.
